**project HT2a-bioactivity-prediction** (in progress)
# Prediction of bioactivity from chemical structure 
## Target: 5-HT2a receptor
## Bioactivity datasets from ChEMBL
### ML features: Morgan fingerprints (2048 bit vector)
### Training / Testing split based on Murcko Scaffold clustering

### Chemical bias controlled with AVE script *(to be done soon)*
